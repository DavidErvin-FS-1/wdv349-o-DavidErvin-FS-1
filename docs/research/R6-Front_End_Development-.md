## Topic - Front End Development with React

This document contains research notes focusing on React development practices, component architecture, and tooling for creating web applications.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 -  React Component Design
React encourages a component-based approach to building user interfaces, emphasizing modular and reusable code.

* Components should follow a single responsibility principle
* Use props for passing data and state management
* Implement prop-types for type checking and documentation

<br>

## Sub-Topic 2 - Project Structure and Organization
Effective folder and file organization is crucial for maintaining scalable React applications.

* Create clear, logical directory structures
* Separate components, styles, utilities, and test files
* Use consistent naming conventions

<br>

## Sub-Topic 3 - Development Tooling and Best Practices
Leveraging tools like ESLint and prop-types can significantly improve code quality and developer experience.

* ESLint helps enforce coding standards and catch potential errors
* Implement prop-type validation for component interfaces
* Integrate static type checking tools

### Sub-Topic 3.1 - TypeScript with React
TypeScript is a popular choice for adding static typing to JavaScript applications, providing enhanced code quality and developer productivity.

* Use TypeScript with React for type safety catching errors sooner
* Leverage TypeScript interfaces for defining component props
* Integrate TypeScript with ESLint for enhanced linting
