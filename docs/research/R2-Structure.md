## Sub-Topic 1 - Understanding Wireframe Importance

Brief overview of why wireframing is crucial for project success.

* **Visualize ideas**: Wireframing gives form to abstract concepts and ideas which enables designers to see how elements will work together on a screen.
* **Identify usability issues**: Wireframes help identify potential usability issues early in the design process, saving time and resources.
* **Communicate design concepts**: Wireframes are an effective way to communicate design concepts to stakeholders and team members.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Wireframing Best Practices

Brief overview of key wireframing methodologies and approaches.

* **Set clear expectations**: Clearly define the purpose and scope of the wireframe to ensure alignment with project goals.
* **Device-specific wireframes**: Create wireframes for different devices to ensure a consistent user experience across platforms.
* **Start simple**: Begin with low-fidelity wireframes to focus on layout and structure before adding visual details.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Common Wireframing Pitfalls

Brief overview of potential issues to avoid.

* **Overcomplicating the Design**: Avoid adding unnecessary elements that may confuse users or detract from the main purpose of the design.
* **Style over Functionality**: Focus on functionality and usability over visual aesthetics to ensure a positive user experience.
* **Details too early**: Avoid getting bogged down in details too early in the design process, as this can hinder creativity and exploration.
