Applying the 20 laws of UX enhances user satisfaction and creates intuitive interfaces. Additionally, avoiding common design mistakes can improve overall usability.

* Key finding 1: Cognitive load should be minimized to help users process information quickly and effortlessly (Hick’s Law).
* Key finding 2: Effective use of whitespace organizes content and reduces visual clutter.
* Key finding 3: Avoid design pitfalls such as inconsistent styles, poor contrast, or overly complex layouts that confuse users.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Dialog Box and Web App Design Best Practices
Brief overview of research:
Dialog boxes and web apps require thoughtful design to ensure they are helpful and non-disruptive to the user’s workflow.

* Key finding 1: Dialog boxes should focus on clarity, actionability, and relevance, avoiding unnecessary interruptions.
