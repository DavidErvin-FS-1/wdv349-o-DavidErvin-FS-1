## Topic - API Design and Documentation Strategies

General notes in this document pertain to best practices in designing APIs and the importance of documentation-driven development to ensure scalability and usability for this project.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - RESTful API Design

RESTful APIs are to be stateless, extendable, and simple to use. Knowing how to understand the core principles of RESTful API design enables one to create productive and user-friendly APIs.

* RESTful APIs follow the stateless architecture style-meaning that each request again will contain all that may be needed to process it.
* Proper API versioning ensures backward compatibility and simplifies the integration of new features.
* Error handling is crucial; APIs should return clear, consistent, and actionable error messages.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 2 - Documentation-Driven Development (DDD)

Documentation-driven development emphasizes writing API documentation before coding to improve project communication and efficiency.

* Writing documentation first clarifies API functionality for developers and stakeholders before coding begins.
* DDD helps identify edge cases early, reducing miscommunication and rework.
* Well-documented APIs improve onboarding and adoption by external users and contributors.

<br>

Sub-Topic 3 - Embed Research into Repository Workflow

This will integrate research findings into the workflow of the repository. Thus, it can improve project efficiency and maintainability.

* Documentation remains current with the developments through weekly updates in the repository docs folder.
* API design and testing can be automated using tools like Swagger or Postman; this output can then be included in documentation.
* Frequently referring to external resources will enable continuous learning and innovation in development practices.
