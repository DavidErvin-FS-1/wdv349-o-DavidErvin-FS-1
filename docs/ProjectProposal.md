## Application Definition Statement

I want to build a single-player RPG game where players can create unique characters, and progress through leveling system to gain experience, skills, and equipment. The game will be text-based, with a focus on interactive decision-making. Players will be able to make choices that affect the outcome of the game, such as choosing which path to take, which enemies to fight, and which items to use. Every decision will have consequences, and players will need to use their skills and equipment wisely to overcome challenges and progress through the game.


## Target Market

The target market for this application is people who enjoy RPG games, and are looking for a text-based experience that they can play anywhere. The game will be designed to be accessible to people of all ages, and will be easy to pick up and play. The game will also be designed to be challenging and engaging, with a focus on strategy and decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Many fans of RPG games seek immersive, skill-based experiences without the complexity of large, downloadable games. They want to be able to play a game that they can pick up and play in short bursts, and that they can access from anywhere. Most RPG games are large, complex, and are not designed for quick, casual play.

## Pain Points

- **Accessibility:** Many RPG games are large, complex, and require a significant time investment to play. This can be a barrier to entry for people who are looking for a quick, casual gaming experience just to pass the time.
- **Portability:** Many RPG games are designed for specific platforms, such as consoles or PCs. This can be a barrier to entry for people who are looking for a game that they can play on their phone or computer.

## Solution Statement

Text RPG simplifies the RPG experience into a web-based format, emphasizing character progression, turn-based combat, and interactive decision-making while providing a quick, strategic gaming experience in the browser, allowing players to jump in, level up, and enjoy quality character development and combat.

## Competition

While there are many text-based RPG games available online, most of them are simple, text-only games that lack depth and complexity. I want to create a text-based RPG game that combines the simplicity of text-based games with the depth and complexity of traditional RPG games, providing players with a rich, immersive experience that they can enjoy anywhere.

Some of the most popular text-based RPG games include:

- **[Kingdom of Loathing]((https://www.kingdomofloathing.com/)):** A humorous, text-based RPG game that features a unique art style and a wide variety of quests and activities.
- **[A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/):** A minimalist, text-based RPG game that focuses on survival and exploration in a post-apocalyptic world.
- **[Torn](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/):** A text-based RPG game that features a modern, crime-themed setting and a wide variety of activities and interactions. [link](https://www.torn.com/)


## Features & Functionality

- **Character Creation:** Players can create unique characters by choosing their name, allocating stat points, and selecting abilities.
- **Progression System:** Players can gain experience, level up, and unlock new abilities and equipment as they progress through the game.
- **Decision-Making:** Players can make decisions that affect the outcome of the game, such as choosing which path to take, which enemies to fight, and which items to use.
- **Combat System:** Players can engage in turn-based combat with enemies, using their abilities and equipment to defeat them.
- **Inventory System:** Players can manage their inventory, equip items, and use consumables to aid them in their journey.


## Integrations

- **[D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/):** I plan to integrate the D&D 5e API to provide data for the game to include equipment, items, and monsters.
- **[RPG Dice Roller](https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/guide/)**: I plan to integrate Dice Roller to provide random number generation for combat and other game mechanics.
